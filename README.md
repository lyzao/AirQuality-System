This is a project for an air quality system where I aim to capture information about the air, including gas levels, temperature, humidity, and pressure, using Arduino sensors such as MQ2 and BME280. You can access the code in this repository. Additionally, I have developed an Android application, which you can find in the repository named 'My Application.' This application will display the air quality information.
